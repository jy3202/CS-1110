FEATURES:
a6dataset.py: 
This file contains the class Dataset, which is the very first part of the assignment.
You cannot do anything in this assignment (except run the unit test) before this class
is finished.

a6cluster.py:
This file contains the class cluster, which is the second part of the assignment.  With
this class done, the visualization can display the centroid of a single cluster.

a6algorithm.py
This file contains the Algorithm class for performing k-means clustering.  While it is
the last part of the assignment, it is the heart of the clustering algorithm.  You
need this class to view the complete visualizer.
